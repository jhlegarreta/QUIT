# Brief Description #

A collection of programs for processing quantitative MRI data, originally DESPOT
but now a wider variety of techniques.

# Thanks #

Many thanks to Samuel Hurley for many, many suggestions.
Thanks to Anna Combes, Amy McDowell and Sjoerd Vos for finding bugs in early
versions.

# Documentation #

Documentation exists in Markdown format in the Docs folder, and is also
available at http://spinicist.github.io/QUIT/

# Installation #

Pre-compiled binaries are provided for Linux and Mac OS X in a .tar.gz archive.
Download the correct archive for your platform, untar it and then ensure that
the binaries can be found via your `PATH` environment variable.

For instructions on how to compile from source, please see the developer page
in the documentation.

# Usage #

Example scripts for mcDESPOT processing are provided in the installation
archive. These print usage instructions if you call them with no arguments.
They take a set of filenames as input, and you will need to modify the scripts
with your particular flip-angles and TRs.

Each product has some basic usage instructions that will be printed with either
the -h or --help options, e.g. `qimcdespot -h`. The majority of programs take
the input filenames as arguments on the command-line, and in addition will read
an input text file from `stdin`. For further details, see the documentation.
