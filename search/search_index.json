However, if you naively run:\n\n\n~: qidespot1 some_spgr_data.nii.gz\n\n\n\n\nNothing will happen. This is because most imaging formats do not store parameters that are required for quantitative imaging, e.g. the repetition time and flip-angles in their headers. QUIT programs hence expect to read this information in a text file passed to \nstdin\n. If you create a small text file \nspgr.txt\n containing the following:\n\n\n{\n    \"SPGR\": {\n        \"TR\": 0.01,\n        \"FA\": [3, 18]\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nand run the following:\n\n\n~: qidespot1 some_spgr_data.nii.gz < spgr.txt\n\n\n\n\nthen (provided your input data does contain two volumes corresponding to flip-angles 3 and 18 degrees) then DESPOT1 will run, and you should see two files created (\nD1_T1.nii.gz\n and \nD1_PD.nii.gz\n). If you want to see what the programs are doing while running, specify the \n--verbose\n or \n-v\n options.\n\n\nFile Formats\n\n\nBy default, QUIT is compiled with support for NIFTI and NRRD formats. The preferred file-format is NIFTI for compatibility with FSL and SPM. By default QUIT will output \n.nii.gz\n files. This can be controlled by the \nQUIT_EXT\n environment variable. Valid values for this are any file extension supported by ITK that QUIT has been compiled to support, e.g. \n.nii\n or \n.nrrd\n, or the FSL values \nNIFTI\n, \nNIFTI_PAIR\n, \nNIFTI_GZ\n, \nNIFTI_PAIR_GZ\n.\n\n\nThe \nITK\n library supports a much wider variety of file formats, but adding support for all of these almost triples the size of the compiled binaries. Hence by default they are excluded. You can add support for more file formats by compiling QUIT yourself, see the \ndeveloper documentation\n. Note that ITK cannot write every format it can read (e.g. it can read Bruker 2dseq datasets, but it cannot write them).\n\n\nScripting\n\n\nThe QUIT tools are designed to be used inside shell scripts or SGE jobs. 3 scripts are provided along with the binaries. \nqi_composer.sh\n uses the \nqi_coil_combine\n program to correctly combine complex data from multiple element RF coils. \nqi_example_mcd_b1.sh\n and \nqi_example_mcd_hifi.sh\n give example mcDESPOT processing pipelines. The first assumes that you have a good B1 map and have already registered all the input volumes to a common reference. The second shows one of doing this using FSL. Registration is beyond the scope of QUIT, so you must have additional tools installed for this.",

Although DESPOT1-HIFI can produce a rough estimate of B1, it often fails to produce reasonable values in the ventricles, and the fact that the MP-RAGE image is often acquired at lower resolution than the SPGR/FLASH data can also cause problems. Hence you should either smooth the B1 map produced as output, or fit it with a \npolynomial\n, then recalculate T1 using the \nDESPOT1\n program. Note that if your MP-RAGE image is not acquired at the same resolution as your SPGR data, it must be resampled to the same spacing before processing (and it should also be registered to your SPGR data).\n\n\nExample Command Line\n\n\nqidespot1hifi spgr_file.nii.gz irspgr_file.nii.gz --mask=mask_file.nii.gz < input.txt\n\n\n\n\nExample Input File\n\n\n{\n    \"SPGR\": {\n        \"TR\": 0.01,\n        \"FA\": [3, 18]\n    },\n    \"MPRAGE\": {\n        \"FA\": 5,\n        \"TR\": 0.01,\n        \"TI\": 0.45,\n        \"TD\": 0,\n        \"eta\": 1,\n        \"ETL\": 64,\n        \"k0\": 0\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor the MPRAGE sequence, the TR is the spacing between readouts/echoes, not the overall segment TR. TI is the Inversion Time, and TD is the Delay Time after the echo-train (often 0). Eta is the Inversion Efficiency, which should be set to 1. ETL is the Echo-Train Length - usually the number of phase encode steps in one segment. k0 defines the position in the echo-train that the center line of k-space is acquired.

Although DESPOT1-HIFI can produce a rough estimate of B1, it often fails to produce reasonable values in the ventricles, and the fact that the MP-RAGE image is often acquired at lower resolution than the SPGR/FLASH data can also cause problems. Hence you should either smooth the B1 map produced as output, or fit it with a  polynomial , then recalculate T1 using the  DESPOT1  program. Note that if your MP-RAGE image is not acquired at the same resolution as your SPGR data, it must be resampled to the same spacing before processing (and it should also be registered to your SPGR data).

It was written because of the inconsistent definitions of co-ordinate systems in pre-clinical imaging. Non-primate mammals are usually scanned prone instead of supine, and are quadrupeds instead of bipeds. This means the definitions of superior/inferior and anterior/posterior are different than in clinical scanning.

Although I hope that most QUIT code is fairly clear, the following is provided to give a high-level overview of how most QUIT programs are structured.\n\n\nBasic Requirements\n\n\n\n\nA C++11 compliant compiler (GCC 4.8.0+, Clang 3.1+)\n\n\nCMake version 3.2 or higher (http://www.cmake.org)\n\n\n\n\nWARNING - You will require a recent compiler for DESPOT as it uses C++11 features. GCC 4.8.0 is a MINIMUM as earlier versions do not support C++11 threads - however you will not be able to build the \nStats\n module without GCC 5.0.0 or later. Clang 3.1 will also work. You can find out the version of your system gcc by running \ngcc -v\n.\n\n\nExternal Libraries\n\n\nQUIT is built using several C++ libraries. These are currently included in the project as git submodules. The easiest way to initialise these is with the \neasy_build.sh\n script. However, if you are already have some of them available you may wish to not run the script and instead configure them yourself. This is discussed further below. The libraries are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgs\n\n\nAn excellent header-only command-line argument parser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCereal\n\n\nA serialization library for C++. Can write to multiple formats (e.g. XML) but QUIT exclusively uses JSON to exploit a couple of useful features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEigen\n\n\nA high performace linear algebra library. Used for all signal equations in QUIT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCeres\n\n\nA high performace, high quality collection of non-linear least squares solvers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nITK\n\n\nThe Insight Tool-Kit. This is intended as a registration library for medical images. Although the registration features are not used in QUIT, the overall framework is extremely useful. In particular, ITK reads a large variety of common file-formats, and all ITK filters automatically check that their inputs share a common space / co-ordinate definition. This single feature alone prevents the vast majority of easy user mistakes - e.g. trying to use a B1 map that has a different voxel spacing to the input data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompilation\n\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with C++/CMake/git etc. a script is provided that should be able to build the tools provided the right software is available on your system. To use it, in a terminal window, change directory to where you unpacked QUIT. Then type \n./easy_build.sh\n. This should correctly checkout the git repositories for each external library, build Ceres and ITK, and then configure and build QUIT.\n\n\nIf you are familiar with C++/CMake/git etc. then compiling QUIT should be straightforward. The rough steps are:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have all the libraries above available. If you do not have system versions, then run \ngit submodule init; git submodule update\n in the QUIT directory.\n\n\nCompile the Ceres library. Make sure it uses the same version of Eigen that you will use for QUIT.\n\n\nCompile ITK following their instructions.\n\n\nCreate a build directory for QUIT and use cmake/ccmake to configure the project. Specify the paths to the library when prompted. It is likely that CMake will report an error on the first 'Configure' attempt if it cannot locate Eigen, specify the correct directory and run the configure step again.\n\n\nCompile QUIT.\n\n\n\n\nFile Formats\n\n\nThe available file formats are controlled by the main \nCMakeLists.txt\n in the root QUIT directory, by listing them as \nCOMPONENTS\n in the ITK \nfind_package()\n step. Add any additional file formats you wish to use here.s\n\n\nTests\n\n\nQUIT programs are tested using the Bash Automated Test System \n(BATS)\n, which is included as a git submodule. To run the tests, point BATS at the Tests directory, e.g. \npath/to/bats QUIT/Test\n, which will run all of the tests. It is possible to run the test files individually as well. It was decided to use BATS instead of a unit-test based framework because this allows the QUIT programs to be tested as a whole, including command-line arguments.\n\n\nMost QUIT programs are tested by generating ground-truth parameter files with \nqinewimage\n, feeding these into \nqisignal\n to generate simulated MR images with added noise, and then running the particular QUIT program to calculate some parameter maps, then comparing these to the ground-truth with \nqidiff\n. \nqidiff\n calculates figure-of-merit based on noise factors, i.e. they are a measure of how much the signal noise is amplified in the final maps. In this way the tests also serve to illustrate the quality of the methods as well as whether the programs run correctly. For programs where a ground-truth image cannot be generated easily, the tests at least ensure that the program runs and does not crash.\n\n\nThe ApplyAlgorithmFilter\n\n\nThe core part of QUIT is the \nApplyAlgorithmFilter\n and its child-class \nAlgorithm\n, found in \n/Source/Filters/\n. This is a sub-class of the ITK \nImageToImageFilter\n. The vast majority of QUIT programs declare an \nAlgorithm\n sub-class and use this to process the data. \nApplyAlgorithmFilter\n abstracts out most of the heavy lifting of extracting voxel-wise data from multiple inputs and writing it out to multiple outputs, leaving the \nAlgorithm\n to process a single-voxel.\n\n\nAn \nAlgorithm\n defines the number of expected inputs and their size, the number of 'constants' or fixed-parameters, and the number of outputs. It would be preferable if \nAlgorithm\n also defined the types of these, and then \nAlgorithm\n was passed as a template-type to \nApplyAlgorithmFilter\n, e.g. \nApplyAlgorithmFilter<DESPOT1Algorithm>\n. However, due to an \nitk::Image<itk::VariableLengthVector, 3>\n being different to an \nitk::VectorImage<float, 3>\n this is not possible. Instead, \nApplyAlgorithmFilter\n takes the input and output types as template parameters, and defines a child-class that has these types available to it. It is these child-classes that developers should sub-class. Several are predefined in the \nApplyTypes.h\n file.\n\n\nExample: qidespot1\n\n\nThe structure of \nqidespot1\n is similar to most QUIT programs, and is a good example of most features. At the start are the includes (obviously). After that several \nAlgorithm\n subclasses are defined, as well as a Ceres cost-function. The Ceres documentation is excellent, so refer to that for more information. After all the \nAlgorithm\n classes are defined, the main program body begins. At the start of the program, all the command-line options are defined and then parsed. Then the various inputs are read and passed to the \nApplyAlgorithmFilter\n, which is then updated. Finally, the outputs are written back to disk.",
